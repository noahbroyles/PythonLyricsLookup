# PythonLyricsLookup
*Look up the lyrics to a song in Python!*

With the code in this repo, you can look up the lyrics to any song! There are 4 different methods for scraping lyrics, in the 4 files `googleLyrics.py`, `googleLyricsJS.py`, `songlyrics.py`, and `geniusLyrics.py`.
## Different files:
In `googleLyrics.py` and `googleLyricsJS.py`:
```python
getLyrics(songSearch)
  ... return title, artist, lyrics
```
In `songlyrics.py`:
```python
getLyrics(songSearch)
  ... return lyrics
